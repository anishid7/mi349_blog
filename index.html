                    When it comes to flying discs, many often think of one of two sports: ultimate frisbee or disc golf. While both involve throwing a disc, they are quite different in how they’re played and what makes them fun.

                    In ultimate frisbee, you’re constantly moving. It’s a team sport as compared to disc golf being a solely single player sport (relative to the real sport of golf),that's played on a field. The whole movement of the game involves a mix of other sports, such as soccer, football, and basketball, but mashed together and played with a frisbee. The goal is to pass the disc to teammates and get it into the opposing team’s end zone. You can’t run with the disc, so quick thinking, teamwork, and a bit of sprinting are all part of the game. Ultimate is fast-paced and exciting, with lots of action and strategy involved.

                    On the other hand, disc golf is more relaxed. It’s played individually, usually on a course with baskets. The aim is to throw the disc from a starting point and get it into a basket in as few throws as possible, much like regular golf. Disc golf is great if you enjoy spending time outdoors and want a laid-back experience. In comparison to ultimate frisbee, the intensity level is knocked down by almost 70%; not saying that disc golf is not also competitive, but the drive of working with a team to win a tournament or a game is a whole different feeling than only congratulating yourself.

                    So why should you join ultimate frisbee. It is a wonderful way to be active, make new friends and bond, and improve your coordination. It's also a great way to get amped and get all that energy out. The game is very friendly to beginners, and is easy to pick up as the environments are very welcoming and encouraging. If staying active and/or participating in team sports sounds interesting to you, ultimate frisbee is the sport for you!

                <h3>Bread Pudding VS. Banana Pudding</h3>
                <h4><author>by Anishi Desai</author></h4>

                    Bread pudding is delectable treat, a dessert made from stale bread, milk, eggs, sugar, and spices, baked until it retains a soft inside with a crispy top. The bread soaks up the mixture, becoming a custard-like dish that can be flavored with extra tastes such as vanilla, cinnamon, or even chocolate. Sometimes raisins or nuts are added, and it’s often served warm with a sauce like caramel or vanilla.

                    Banana pudding, on the other hand, is a cold, creamy dessert made with layers of vanilla pudding, fresh bananas, and cookies like vanilla wafers. It’s usually topped with whipped cream or meringue and chilled before serving. The bananas add a fresh, fruity flavor, while the cookies soften in the pudding for a nice texture contrast. So, how do these two compare? Lets find out.

                    Bread pudding has a heavier, richer taste because of the baked bread and custard, while banana pudding is lighter and sweeter due to the fresh bananas and whipped topping. Bread pudding feels more like comfort food, perfect for colder days, while banana pudding is refreshing and great for summer. Feeling out these two desserts to see which one you like more is definitely a trial and error type adventure, but there's no harm in making a whole load of banana and bread pudding just to see how that goes.

                    Personally, I find bread pudding to be the number one pick of the two. Although I haven't had bread pudding or banana pudding all that much, the times that I have had bread pudding have knocked my socks off without question. The savoriness of the vanilla and cinammon flavors just explode in your mouth and its just indescribable. I am also a huge cinammon fan so I may be biased. However, banana pudding wins when I'm in the mood for something lighter and fruity. Both are delicious in their own ways, but bread pudding has that cozy, homemade vibe that’s hard to beat. (Below is a picture of bread pudding that I made personally for Christmas dessert!)
